1. Life. Life is shaped by what we miss, whether it is people, experiences, or opportunities. If it weren’t, we wouldn’t always be talking about them. It is like the Higgs mechanism. Particles interact with the Higgs field to gain mass. The stronger the interaction, the heavier the particle. The things we miss act as our Higgs field, shaping the substance of our existence. The more we engage with what we miss, the more profound our existential weight becomes, just as a particle gains mass through deeper interaction with the Higgs field. Just as particles gain mass through interaction with the Higgs field, life gains meaning through our engagement with what we miss. 
2. Life. Those who misunderstand life end up living it the wrong way.
