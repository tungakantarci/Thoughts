1. Life. Life is the sum of the things we lack, whether people, experiences, or opportunities. If it weren’t, we wouldn’t always be talking about them. It is like the Higgs mechanism. Particles interact with the Higgs field to gain mass. The stronger the interaction, the heavier the particle. The things we lack, say our parents who passed away, is the Higgs field. The more we interact with what we lack, the more life comes through. Just as particles gain mass through interaction with the Higgs field, life gains meaning through our engagement with what we lack.
2. Life. Those who misunderstand life end up living it the wrong way.
