1. Life. Life is shaped by what we miss, whether it is people, experiences, or opportunities. If it weren’t, we wouldn’t always be talking about them. It is like the Higgs mechanism. Particles interact with the Higgs field to gain mass. The stronger the interaction, the heavier the particle. The things we miss, say our parents who passed away, is the Higgs field. The more we interact with what we miss, the heaiver is our existential weight. Just as particles gain mass through interaction with the Higgs field, life gains meaning through our engagement with what we miss.
2. Life. Those who misunderstand life end up living it the wrong way.
